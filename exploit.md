To reproduce the attack:

1- Head to the http://localhost/nipah-tms/registered-user-testing.php endpoint

2- Here you would be asked to give a value in the "Registered Mobile Number" parameter. Simply input any random number as it won't accept any text and symbols.

3- As soon as you hit "Search" intercept the request and then replace the mobilenumber in the "regmobilenumber" parameter with "<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>" payload and forward the request.

4- In the response you can see that the payload is directly embedded into the HTML content without proper sanitization or encoding, and hence, a pop-up is shown with the Cookie.

5- Although Reflected XSS is not as critical as Stored XSS but still it can be used to steal user session cookies, allowing the attacker to impersonate the victim and perform actions on their behalf and can even redirect users to malicious websites. 

**Remediation:** 

1- Validate and sanitize user input on the server side. Ensure that input adheres to expected patterns and formats.

2- Encode user input before displaying it in the HTML output. HTML-encode special characters to prevent them from being interpreted as HTML or JavaScript.
